KSail supports the following operating systems:

- MacOS (x64 and arm64)
- Linux (x64 and arm64)

### Installation

With Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap devantler-tech/formulas
brew install ksail
```

Manually:

1. Download the latest release for your OS from the [releases page](https://github.com/devantler-tech/ksail/releases).
2. Make the binary executable: `chmod +x ksail`.
3. Move the binary to a directory in your `$PATH`: `mv ksail /usr/local/bin/ksail`.

### Usage

Getting started with KSail is easy. First, you need to configure what cluster you want KSail to manage.

`> ksail gen config ksail` - To generate a new KSail configuration file.

Now you can make changes to the configuration file to your liking, and when you are ready to initialize a new cluster, you can run:

`> ksail init` - To initialize a new cluster configuration based on your KSail configuration.

From there, you probably want to ensure that your distribution and ksail is configured to your liking.

- `kind-config.yaml` - The configuration file for Kind.
- `k3d-config.yaml` - The configuration file for K3d.

When you are ready to provision your cluster, you can run:

`> ksail up` - To provision your new cluster.

From there, you can make some changes to your manifest files, and when you are ready to apply them, you can run:

`> ksail update` - To update your cluster.

And for more advanced debugging, you can run:

`> ksail debug` - To debug your cluster with the K9s tool.

Finally, when you are done working with your cluster, you can run:

`> ksail stop` - To stop your cluster, so you can continue working on it later.

Or if you really want to get rid of it for now, you can run:

`> ksail down` - To dismantle your cluster and remove its resources.

## Sub-projects

KSail is part of a larger ecosystem of projects that I maintain. These projects are designed to provide important functionality to KSail with high confidence, and without bloating the main repository. Most the projects provide extensible frameworks, so you can build your own tools on top of them, or make contributions to make KSail even more powerful.

- **[devantler-tech/dotnet-cli-runner](https://github.com/devantler-tech/dotnet-cli-runner)** - An implementation atop CLI Wrap to support running different binaries from C# code.
